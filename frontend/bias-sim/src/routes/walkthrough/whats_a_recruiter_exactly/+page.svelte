	What's a Recruiter, Exactly?
</h3>
<div class="flex justify-center pt-10 pb-10 text-center">

		<p>
			In the first page of the walkthrough, we said that a
			<span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Recruiter</span>
			was a machine which produces
			a <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Decision</span> for each
			<span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Application</span>.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-16">
			Because we're using <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Machine Learning</span>,
			we train each of our recruiters on a list of <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Training Examples</span>.
			Each training example is an application and corresponding decision.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-16">
			In total, in this project, we implement seven different recruiters based on modern machine learning algorithms.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			Most of these require quite a background in computer science to understand. However, it's
			difficult to understand this project fully unless you have some sort of idea of how exactly they
			make decisions.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			So, I'm, going to explain one of the simpler architectures here, the
			<span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Random Forest</span> recruiter.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-16">
			Decision Trees
		</h3>
		<p class="mt-4">
			In order to talk about those we have to talk about a simpler model, the
			<span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Decision Tree</span> recruiter.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
			Below is an example of a decision tree:
		</p>
		<div class="border-black border-2 rounded-md">
			<DecisionTree useAnimation={false} />
		</div>
		<p class="mt-4">
			We can see it's a set of questions to ask about an application
			which eventually leads a recruiter to make a decision.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			A <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Tree</span> is a concept in computer science for the
			structure of this object, because it branches out, just like a tree might.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-16 mb-4">
			Once we have our decision tree, it's fairly easy to see how we might build a recruiter. We just use
			this decision tree on each application we get:
		</p>
		<div class="border-black border-2 rounded-md">
			<DecisionTree useAnimation={true} />
		</div>
		<p class="mt-8">
			But how do we build that decision tree in the first place?
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			This happens in the recruiters training stage.
			When we give the recruiter the training examples,
			it looks through every possible question it could ask about the data and then chooses
			the question which is most useful to ask first.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			It works out which question is most useful, by calculating which one splits the training examples
			into classes it can label <span class="text-success-800 font-bold">Hired</span> and <span
			class="text-error-600 font-bold">Not Hired</span>
			such that the fewest examples are in the wrong class as possible.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			After that it chooses the next best question, until it's fully created a decision tree.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			So when <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Training</span> the recruiter,
			we build a decision tree, and when <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Using</span> the recruiter,
			we use that to make a decision on each of the applications.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-16">
			The Random Forest Recruiter
		</h3>
		<p class="mt-8">
			Unfortunately, this doesn't work too well in practice.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			What happens is that these decision trees end up memorising all the training examples,
			rather than actually finding patterns.
			When we use the recruiter in practice, it makes
			the same decision that was made on the closest training example, even if
			that decision doesn't match the rest of the data.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			To fix this, we donâ€™t rely on just one decision tree.
			Instead, we build lots of them, each trained on a different slice of the data.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			Lots of trees make a forest, so we call this the
			the <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Random Forest recruiter</span>.
			Let's take a look at how it works now:
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			During <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Training</span>, we create multiple
			<span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Decision Tree Subrecruiters</span>,
			each with a slightly different version of the training examples
			examples.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-6">
			For each subrecruiter,
			We randomly remove some of the training examples
			and remove the same random parts of every application.
			Then, we train the subrecruiter on these training examples.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-12">
			When <span class="text-surface-600 font-bold">Using</span> the recruiter, we ask each of the
			decision tree sub-recruiters for a decision and select the most common decision.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-16">
			Next Steps
		</h3>
		<p class="mt-4">
			So we've seen how to generate candidates, and what a machine-learning recruiter might look
			like in practice.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			The final question we need to answer is how to measure how biased a recruiter is,
			based on the decisions it makes. We'll see that in the next section.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			Finally we'll be able to put everything together
			and run our simulation.
